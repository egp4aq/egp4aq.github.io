As a young woman experiencing her assent into adulthood, I too was faced with this age old question. To save you the trouble, I will share what I learned on this quest. \n\n## From Virginia to Minnesota, I can't offer much more than this\n\nThis drive is all to familiar to me, so I offer only this.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IMG_6581.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## CORN PALACE\n\nAs a Midwesterner at heart, and a long time admirer of the butter sculpture at the Minnesota State Fair, this palace of corn appealed to me greatly. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IMG_6614.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## MOUNT RUSHMORE\n\nIt's quite peculiar. You think that there might some big monumental moment (pun intended), but there's not. It really is just 4 heads carved into this rock! However, it is very beautiful. Maybe just a bit smaller than anticipated.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IMG_6633.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## ARCHES NATIONAL PARK\n\nIt's hard to describe the elation I felt running around on these red rocks after so many days in the car. I felt like I was nearly bouncing.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IMG_6651.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## GRAND CANYON\n\nIt truly is grand. As we were approaching, we saw a lot of canyons. We kept asking ourselves... is that it? Are we sure we're going to know when we're there? We certainly did. It's quite unmissable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IMG_6671.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## We made it\n\nBoy oh boy was I nervous to see this sign. I'm not sure that those nerves subsided for a couple of days. But look at us now :)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IMG_6685.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n",
