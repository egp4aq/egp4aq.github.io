Hi, I’m Liz Peterson, a recent graduate of the Environmental Data Science master’s program at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmnetal Science and Management, where I focused on using data to address climate change through an equity-driven lens.

I’m passionate about climate justice, conservation, and policy, especially when they intersect with real communities and real solutions. With a background in environmental science and data science from the University of Virginia, I bring both technical skills and lived experience to environmental storytelling and advocacy.

Take a look at my [About page](about.qmd) to learn more, or head over to the [Blog](posts.qmd) to see what I’ve been thinking about lately.
