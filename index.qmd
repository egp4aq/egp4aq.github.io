Hi, welcome to my website! I'm Liz Peterson. I am currently a Master's student at the University of California - Santa Barbara pursuing a degree in Environmental Data Science. I graduated from the University of Virginia (2024) with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Environmental Science and a minor in Data Science. 

I have a passion for climate justice as a way to help those who are disproportionately affected by climate change. I love pursuing a degree that gives me the technical skills to use data to advocate for our planet. Check out my about page to learn more about me, or take a look at my blog!
