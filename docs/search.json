    "text": "Introduction\nOn Halloween 1991, a massive blizzard hit Minnesota. This event has lived on in cultural infamy among Minnesotans. Of the 25 top snowfall events in Minnesota (from 1884-2023), only 5 of them occurred in the 21st century. There seems to be a trend away from high intensity snowfall events. This is a curious question: as the onset of climate change raises temperatures and increases the occurrence of extreme weather events, what does this mean for blizzards and intense snowfall events? Are there fewer intense snowfall events? Is that correlated to an increase in atmospheric CO2? And, if so, does that align with other trends we see in weather patterns?\nAs the general public becomes more worried about the reality of what a warming planet means for them, more research about how climate change might influence weather patterns is being conducted. There are studies analyzing what a warmer planet means for snowfall events, but these are mostly looking at worldwide trends. This analysis aims to see how this is working in Minnesota, a place where snow has a lot of cultural meaning."

    "text": "Data details\nTo examine these questions, we will need to gather some important data: extensive weather and precipitation data from Minnesota, atmospheric CO2 concentration data, and some information about specific snowfall events.\nThe precipitation data came from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. While this platform has a huge volume of data from all over, you are only allowed to request said data in 10 year chunks. Therefore, the chunks of data I downloaded were: 1985/01/01 - 1994/01/01, 1994/01/02 - 2003/12/31, 2004/01/01 - 2013/12/31, and 2014/01/01 - 2023/12/31. The weather station where the data was recorded was the Minneapolis Saint Paul international airport, which is located in Southeast Minnesota. Find this data, or conduct a search for any other weather station data, here.\nThe atmospheric CO2 data comes from an R package called hockeystick. The package is very robust with all sorts of climate adjacent information. This includes atmospheric CO2, methane, emissions, instrumental and proxy temperature records, sea levels, Arctic/Antarctic sea-ice, Hurricanes, and Paleo climate data. This is a very accessible way to begin making climate models with open source software. To get more information about this package, read the package’s documentation here.\nTo make analysis easier, when we read in the data, we are going to do some cleaning immediately. We will use janitor to transform all of the column names in the the weather data to lower snake case. The data also comes with a lot of columns and observations of weather phenomena, but we are only interested in the hourly precipitation data, so we will drop all other columns. Additionally, for a few of the data, the hourly precipitation data is not numeric, so we will make sure to change that column to be of type numeric.\n\n\nOpen code\n# Read in weather data\n# 1985/01/01 - 1994/01/01\nweather_1985_1994 &lt;- read_csv(here('posts/2024-12-13-msp-weather/data/85-94.csv')) %&gt;% # Read in csv\n  janitor::clean_names() %&gt;% # convert column names to lower snake case\n  select(station, date, hourly_precipitation) %&gt;% # select only columns we are interested in\n  mutate(hourly_precipitation = as.numeric(hourly_precipitation))\n\n# 1994/01/02 - 2003/12/31\nweather_1994_2003 &lt;- read_csv(here('posts/2024-12-13-msp-weather/data/94-03.csv')) %&gt;%\n  janitor::clean_names() %&gt;%\n  select(station, date, hourly_precipitation) %&gt;%\n  mutate(hourly_precipitation = as.numeric(hourly_precipitation))\n\n# 2004/01/01 - 2013/12/31\nweather_2004_2014 &lt;- read_csv(here('posts/2024-12-13-msp-weather/data/04-14.csv')) %&gt;%\n  janitor::clean_names() %&gt;%\n  select(station, date, hourly_precipitation) %&gt;%\n  mutate(hourly_precipitation = as.numeric(hourly_precipitation))\n\n# 2014/01/01 - 2023/12/31\nweather_2014_2023 &lt;- read_csv(here('posts/2024-12-13-msp-weather/data/14-23.csv')) %&gt;%\n  janitor::clean_names() %&gt;%\n  select(station, date, hourly_precipitation) %&gt;%\n  mutate(hourly_precipitation = as.numeric(hourly_precipitation))\n\n\nReading in the CO2 data is much simpler, because of the hockeystick package in R.\n\n\nOpen code\n# Read in emissions data\nco2 &lt;- get_carbon()"

This means that we can be 97.5% sure that the true intercept falls within that range. More importantly for our CO2 variable we get [0.01533981 0.01752864]. This means that we are 97.5% confident that the true value for our gamma regression falls within that range.

To begin, climate change by nature is a study best done in the long term. When you look too microscopically at weather trends, they are simply that: weather, not climate. On that note, doing this analysis on a larger time scale might allow for more nuance in the results. Additionally, it is difficult to get a measure of these high intensity storm events specifically without simply looking at average precipitation, as I did here. Perhaps future studies could look at those events more specifically within these trends. Lastly, adding another geographic element could be an interesting avenue to explore. Minnesota is near and dear to my heart, which is why I chose it. I would be interested, however, to see how these trends might differ across the country and even the world.\n\nReferences\nChavez, A., & Jansen, J.

    "text": "Air Quality Index data analysis\nBefore we do any analysis, our first step is always to read in our necessary libraries\n\nimport os\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nimport xarray as xr\nimport rioxarray as rioxr\n\nFor the AQI data, we are going to read in the csv files directly from their url.\n\naqi_17 = pd.read_csv(\"https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/daily_aqi_by_county_2017.zip\", compression='zip')\naqi_18 = pd.read_csv(\"https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/daily_aqi_by_county_2018.zip\", compression='zip')\n\nNow we can do our analysis! This first part includes cleaning the aqi data, evaluating the rolling average, and plotting our results.\n\nCombine and clean data\nFirst, we bring together our dataframes from 2017 and 2018. Then we clean the column names by putting them all in lower snake case. Finally, we filter the data to only Santa Barbara and drop unnecessary columns.\n\n# Use the concat() function to combine the two dataframes\naqi = pd.concat([aqi_17, aqi_18])\n\n# Simplify column names\naqi.columns = (aqi.columns\n                  .str.lower()\n                  .str.replace(' ','_'))\n\n# Filter to data only from Santa Barbara county\naqi_sb = aqi[aqi['county_name'] == 'Santa Barbara']\n# Drop state_name, county_name, state_code, and county_code columns from dataframe\naqi_sb = aqi.drop(['state_name','county_name','state_code','county_code'], axis = 1)\n\n\n\nTake rolling average of AQI data\nNext, we put the date as the index of our dataframe so that we can use the index to take a rolling average over five days.\n\n# Convert 'date' column to be of type datetime\naqi_sb.date = pd.to_datetime(aqi_sb['date'])\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.set_index('date')\n\n# Calculate AQI rolling average over 5 days\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.sort_index(ascending=False)\nrolling_average = aqi_sb['aqi'].rolling('5D').mean()\n\n# Add a new column which includes the mean AQI for the 5 day rolling window \naqi_sb['five_day_average'] = rolling_average\n\n\n\nPlot\nAnd now we can plot! We are going to plot the five day average over the total data.\n\n# Plot aqi and five_day_average\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\nplt.plot(aqi_sb.index.values,\n         aqi_sb['aqi'],\n         color = \"orange\")\nplt.plot(aqi_sb.index.values,\n         aqi_sb['five_day_average'],\n         color = \"blue\")\nplt.xticks(rotation = 45)\nplt.xlabel(\"Date\")\nplt.ylabel(\"AQI\")\nplt.title(\"Santa Barbara AQI (2017-2018)\")\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Santa Barbara AQI (2017-2018)')"
