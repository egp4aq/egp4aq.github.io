This fire had huge implications, as it displaced over 100,000 southern California residents, required the largest deployment of firefighters in California history to combat a wildfire, and cost over $200 million to fight.\nTo analyze the impact of the wildfire, we will look into the implications for air quality in the surrounding areas and how the vegetation was impacted using false color imagery.\n\n\n\nthomas_fire_picture.jpg"

This first part includes cleaning the aqi data, evaluating the rolling average, and plotting our results.\n\nCombine and clean data\nFirst, we bring together our dataframes from 2017 and 2018. Then we clean the column names by putting them all in lower snake case. Finally, we filter the data to only Santa Barbara and drop unnecessary columns.\n\n# Use the concat() function to combine the two dataframes\naqi = pd.concat([aqi_17, aqi_18])\n\n# Simplify column names\naqi.columns = (aqi.columns\n                  .str.lower()\n                  .str.replace(' ','_'))\n\n# Filter to data only from Santa Barbara county\naqi_sb = aqi[aqi['county_name'] == 'Santa Barbara']\n# Drop state_name, county_name, state_code, and county_code columns from dataframe\naqi_sb = aqi.drop(['state_name','county_name','state_code','county_code'], axis = 1)\n\n\n\nTake rolling average of AQI data\nNext, we put the date as the index of our dataframe so that we can use the index to take a rolling average over five days.\n\n# Convert 'date' column to be of type datetime\naqi_sb.date = pd.to_datetime(aqi_sb['date'])\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.set_index('date')\n\n# Calculate AQI rolling average over 5 days\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.sort_index(ascending=False)\nrolling_average = aqi_sb['aqi'].rolling('5D').mean()\n\n# Add a new column which includes the mean AQI for the 5 day rolling window \naqi_sb['five_day_average'] = rolling_average\n\n\n\nPlot\nAnd now we can plot! We are going to plot the five day average over the total data.\n\n# Plot aqi and five_day_average\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\nplt.plot(aqi_sb.index.values,\n         aqi_sb['aqi'],\n         color = \"orange\")\nplt.plot(aqi_sb.index.values,\n         aqi_sb['five_day_average'],\n         color = \"blue\")\nplt.xticks(rotation = 45)\nplt.xlabel(\"Date\")\nplt.ylabel(\"AQI\")\nplt.title(\"Santa Barbara AQI (2017-2018)\")\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Santa Barbara AQI (2017-2018)')"
