    "text": "Hi, welcome to my website! I’m Liz Peterson. I am currently a Master’s student at the University of California - Santa Barbara pursuing a degree in Environmental Data Science. I graduated from the University of Virginia (2024) with a Bachelor’s degree in Environmental Science and a minor in Data Science. She realized the importance of technical coding skills while conducting research on sea ice loss in the Northern Hemisphere as it is connected to greenhouse gas emissions.\nThese various experiences have given Liz a passion for climate justice as a way to help those who are disproportionately affected by climate change. She looks forward to gaining more technical skills in MEDS to work on projects that amplify the experiences of those not heard."
