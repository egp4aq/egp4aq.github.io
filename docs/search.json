My small group of Ambassadors conducted a study on natural gas use in Charlottesville, engaging with community members to explore the impacts of energy cost on their daily lives.\nOn campus, I logged 268 hours volunteering at HelpLine, a student-run crisis hotline, as both a volunteer and a trainer.\nI also worked for the Contemplative Sciences Center at UVA, where I dedicated time to helping students and faculty access resources to thrive internally."

This fire had huge implications, as it displaced over 100,000 southern California residents, required the largest deployment of firefighters in California history to combat a wildfire, and cost over $200 million to fight.\nTo analyze the impact of the wildfire, we will look into the implications for air quality in the surrounding areas and how the vegetation was impacted using false color imagery."
