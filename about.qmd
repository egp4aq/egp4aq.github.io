## [About Me]{.title}

I’m Elizabeth Peterson, a recent graduate of the Master of Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. I work at the intersection of data, climate justice, and policy — with a strong interest in building tools and systems that promote equity and conservation in the face of climate change.

My background combines a B.A. in Environmental Science with a Data Science minor from the University of Virginia, and hands-on experience in geospatial analysis, machine learning, and environmental modeling. At Bren, I developed technical fluency in tools like Python, R, and GIS, and used those skills to explore how decarbonization might impact labor markets along California’s Central Coast through my capstone work with the 2035 Initiative.

But my interest in climate work has always been grounded in people. During undergrad, I served as a Climate Justice Ambassador in Charlottesville, engaging directly with residents about natural gas use and energy burdens. I also volunteered over 250 hours with a student-run crisis hotline and supported contemplative research at UVA, learning how care and community can intersect with science and service.

Now, I’m excited to bring these experiences together in roles that center climate equity, data-informed policy, and collaborative, on-the-ground work. I’m especially drawn to projects that ask hard questions, and build tools that make answers more actionable.

## [Just for Fun]{.title}

When I’m not working with data, I like to learn new tricks with a Japanese skill toy called the kendama. (It’s great for focus, and surprisingly humbling.) Since moving to Santa Barbara, I’ve been spending time outdoors hiking, swimming, and cautiously learning how to surf.

I also love reading and watching movies, though I hesitate to call myself a “film buff” or a “serious reader.” I just enjoy logging and rating what I take in. You can judge my taste for yourself on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/159610476-liz-peterson) and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/yeetlizpete/) — maybe it’s just another way for me to collect as much data as possible.
