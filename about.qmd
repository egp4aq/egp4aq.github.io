## [My work]{.title}

During my undergraduate career, I worked for the Charlottesville Community Climate Collaborative as a Climate Justice Ambassador. My small group of Ambassadors conducted a study on natural gas use in Charlottesville, engaging with community members to explore the impacts of energy cost on their daily lives.

On campus, I logged 268 hours volunteering at HelpLine, a student-run crisis hotline, as both a volunteer and a trainer. 

I also worked for the Contemplative Sciences Center at UVA, where I dedicated time to helping students and faculty access resources to thrive internally.
