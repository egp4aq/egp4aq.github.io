## [My work]{.title}

During my undergraduate career, I worked for the Charlottesville Community Climate Collaborative as a Climate Justice Ambassador. My small group of Ambassadors conducted a study on natural gas use in Charlottesville, engaging with community members to explore the impacts of energy cost on their daily lives.

On campus, I logged 268 hours volunteering at HelpLine, a student-run crisis hotline, as both a volunteer and a trainer. 

I also worked for the Contemplative Sciences Center at UVA, where I dedicated time to helping students and faculty access resources to thrive internally.


## [My fun]{.title}

I love a Japanese skill toy called the kendama. There are always new tricks to learn! 
As shown in my first blog post, I am new to the Santa Barbara area and California in general. I have loved exploring by hiking, swimming, and surfing. 
Though I am always wary of calling myself a “big reader” or a “film buff” as people find a lot of pride and identity in these terms, I do love reading and watching movies. This past year, I have discovered the joy of logging and rating books and movies. I’ve attached my goodreads and letterboxd so you can judge my tastes.
