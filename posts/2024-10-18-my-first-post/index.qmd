Have you ever asked yourself, how would I go about getting from Falls Church, Virginia to Santa Barbara, California? As a young woman experiencing her assent into adulthood, I too was faced with this age old question. To save you the trouble, I will share what I learned on this quest. 

## From Virginia to Minnesota, I can't offer much more than this

This drive is all to familiar to me, so I offer only this.

## CORN PALACE

As a Midwesterner at heart, and a long time admirer of the butter sculpture at the Minnesota State Fair, this palace of corn appealed to me greatly.

## MOUNT RUSHMORE

It's quite peculiar. You think that there might some big monumental moment (pun intended), but there's not. It really is just 4 heads carved into this rock! However, it is very beautiful. Maybe just a bit smaller than anticipated.

```

## ARCHES NATIONAL PARK

It's hard to describe the elation I felt running around on these red rocks after so many days in the car. I felt like I was nearly bouncing.

#| echo: false

```

## GRAND CANYON

It truly is grand. As we were approaching, we saw a lot of canyons. We kept asking ourselves... is that it? Are we sure we're going to know when we're there? We certainly did. It's quite unmissable.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("IMG_6671.jpg")
```

## We made it

Boy oh boy was I nervous to see this sign. I'm not sure that those nerves subsided for a couple of days. But look at us now :)
