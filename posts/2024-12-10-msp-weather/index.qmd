The weather station where the data was recorded was the Minneapolis Saint Paul international airport. 


The emissions data comes from an R package called hockeystick. The package is very robust, including atmospheric CO2, methane, emissions, instrumental and proxy temperature records, sea levels, Arctic/Antarctic sea-ice, Hurricanes, and Paleoclimate data.
